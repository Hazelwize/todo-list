# Full Stack Todo List
This is a simple full stack todo list. It includes all of the CRUD operations using an MVC architecture.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose

This was a fun project to create. It uses all of the CRUD operations and takes advantage of using the ObjectID provided by MongoDB to locate and edit/delete documents. Creating Mongoose Schema for the todo items makes it so nice to work with the database. Knowing that everything will be organized on the back-end makes working with the front end so much nicer.

## Optimizations

I would like to go back and add React as the front-end framework. It would take this exact code and beautify it into something that people would enjoy using a lot more. I will be doing that in when time allows me to do so.
## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me understand the importance of using unique identifiers for all of your rendered items. Having a Schema really is the way to go for organization. I can see this really coming in handy for future projects that are more complex and using multiple collections or databases.
